    <h2>Music</h2>
    Most of my music can be found on <a href="https://themiddleware.bandcamp.com/">bandcamp</a> or <a href="https://soundcloud.com/themiddleware">soundcloud</a>. Its basicaly random stuff i record on my synths.

    <h3>Synths</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Behringer Crave -- most songs on all of my albums from 2022 were recorded on this. I use it mostly for bass, as master clock and for experimenting.</li>
        <li>Monotron duo -- my first synth, I haven't used it for a long time since I borrowed it, but now I have it back and I modded it so I use it as backing voice.</li>
        <li>Monotron delay -- probably cheapest delay effect on the market with free synth included. I use the delay on most tracks. I also modded it so I used it as backing voice. Its also great for travelling since its small.</li>
        <li>PO-33 -- my wild card, I use it mostly for drums since I don't have analog drum machine. I also use its massive sampling capabillities (e.g on my album weak).</li>
        <li>Volca Keys -- hands-on instrument. I can make any sound in seconds. I use it mostly for chords, bass and lead</li>
        <li>Passive mixer -- I've build simple passive 5 channel mixer with attenuators. It does the job, but it sometimes breaks.</li>
        <li>Modular -- I'm working on custom DIY modular, becuase its best way to build custom synts.</li>
        <li>Keystep -- for controlling crave and volca, I'm running midi from it thru crave to volca, where each synth has different channel.</li>
        <li>Kastle ARP -- my exploration synth, DIYed at bastl party</li>
        <li>SoftPop SPII -- beast synth that is very performative</li>
    </ul>
