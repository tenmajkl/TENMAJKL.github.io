    <h2>Music</h2>
    Most of my music can be found on <a href="https://themiddleware.bandcamp.com/">bandcamp</a> or <a href="https://soundcloud.com/themiddleware">soundcloud</a>. Its basicaly random stuff i record on my synths.

    <h3>Synths</h3>
    
    - Behringer Crave - most songs on all of my albums from 2022 were recorded on this. I use it mostly for bass, as master clock and for experimenting.
    - Monotron duo - my first synth, I haven't used it for a long time since I borrowed it, but now I have it back and I modded it so I use it as backing voice.
    - Monotron delay - probably cheapest delay effect on the market with free synth included. I use the delay on most tracks. I also modded it so I used it as backing voice. Its also great for travelling since its small.
    - PO-33 - my wild card, I use it mostly for drums since I don't have analog drum machine. I also use its massive sampling capabillities (e.g on my album weak).
    - Volca Keys - my newest synth, I use it mostly for chords and lead. But I'm still learning how to integrate between them.
    - Passive mixer - I've build simple passive 3 channel mixer with attenuators. It does the job, but I'm running out of channels and it sometimes breaks.
    - Modular - I'm working on custom DIY modular, becuase its best way to build custom synts.
